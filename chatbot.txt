Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn from data and improve their performance over time without being explicitly programmed.
Data science is the interdisciplinary field that extracts insights and knowledge from structured and unstructured data through methods from statistics, computer science, and domain expertise.
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence in machines designed to perform tasks that typically require human cognition, such as learning, reasoning, and problem-solving.
Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability, making it an ideal choice for both beginners and experienced developers. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. Python has a rich standard library and an active community that contributes to a wide array of third-party packages, enabling developers to build applications in various domains, such as web development, data analysis, machine learning, automation, and scientific computing. With its cross-platform compatibility, Python is widely used across industries, and its clean syntax allows for quick development and easy maintenance of code.
Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that focuses on using artificial neural networks with many layers (hence the term "deep") to model and solve complex tasks. These multi-layered networks, known as deep neural networks, are capable of automatically learning representations of data by processing it through successive layers of increasingly abstract features. Deep learning is especially effective for large datasets and unstructured data like images, audio, and text. Techniques such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are commonly used for tasks like image classification, speech recognition, language translation, and even generating creative content. Deep learning has driven significant advances in artificial intelligence, enabling state-of-the-art performance in fields such as computer vision, natural language processing, and reinforcement learning.
